- Critique of **Sapiensüìí**<span id='yTroiSPXX'/>
    - **Whyvert**: A few comments on Yuval Noah Harari's bestseller "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" (2014). It is short, vigorous, and engaging.<span id='_v7twRYZU'/>
        - Its focus on Three Big Revolutions makes for a clear overview of history. Its a simplification, but that's OK. https://t.co/R9thBiGSqp - **Twitter thread** by **Whyvert**, [link](https://twitter.com/whyvert/status/1194837050702225408)<span id='sH7ZnOx3g'/>
        - But that Cognitive Revolution. Suddenly, 70,000 years ago, humans became ‚Äúas intelligent, creative, and sensitive as we are‚Äù. Suddenly, people could have understood quantum physics. https://t.co/xitoUkqAlL<span id='MQZ0YSrOQ'/>
            - ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EJTq2EaVUAAAwMh.png)<span id='hefoQ_X55'/>
            - Not very likely. Many forager peoples have numbering systems consisting of "one, two, many". Paul Dirac is going to be able to lecture to them on quantum physics?<span id='AtHq6sU0R'/>
                - In any case, his 70,000 date is based on when he thinks modern humans began leaving Africa. There's now evidence modern humans were in Asia long before that. Human cognitive evolution is a lot more complicated than one Revolution that suddenly turned everyone from dumb to smart.<span id='3p0LtOe1J'/>
                    - Thanks to the big brain everyone suddenly acquired in the Cognitive Revolution, humankind escaped from the realm of biology into the realm of culture.<span id='6Nc2I3U5R'/>
                        - Maybe it would be better to say that BOTH culture AND biology have been important, both before and after this event? https://t.co/1is6A5Q3EA<span id='LL8ay3L0F'/>
                        - ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EJTtJcGVAAACH7z.png)<span id='Qx5g1s77n'/>
                        - Harari's understanding of culture is questionable. He thinks of it as fictions or myths (not eg as norms).<span id='DWUr5xvHN'/>
                            - Why do people cooperate? Harari thinks it is because of fictions/myths https://t.co/uivLf0opuE<span id='WYOeagYiV'/>
                            - ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EJTuJX8UUAEfil5.png)<span id='9zrY0Unqj'/>
                            - According to Harari, fictions and myths are what allow humans to rule the earth.<span id='i0YSz9gFU'/>
                                - He seems to discount such parts of culture as knowledge or norms/rules/laws.<span id='5MEX6S4gM'/>
                                - Everything is fictional. https://t.co/1r133U9FVe<span id='sBmDB9zlV'/>

                                - Next comes the Agricultural Revolution. Harari echoes Jared Diamond, who has called it mankind's biggest mistake, by claiming it was history's biggest fraud.<span id='RzQJim_Ol'/>
                                    - (I will say he does not idealize hunter-gatherers.) https://t.co/6PXH6cYOYV<span id='9fYoidC83'/>

                                    - To say that "plants domesticated Homo sapiens" is a funny comment on how their genes have spread, but it is not an explanation of the origins of farming<span id='kFiu1Au67'/>
                                        - Was agriculture such a big fraud or mistake?<span id='Z9KxwC3wG'/>
                                            - This thread has already gotten longer than I intended, so I will pause and return tomorrow.<span id='CTyUBeg8u'/>
                                            - The main gain from farming was permanent settlement (some lucky foragers along salmon rivers already had it). With settlement you can build a religious site, develop craft manufacturing, build a defensive palisade. So it is not all fraud or error.<span id='vIaeRpE67'/>
                                                - Harari claims that scholars used to think of cultures as completely unchanging (strawman alert!). He asserts they are constantly in flux (is this a new orthodoxy?).<span id='nT2WvI67a'/>
                                                    - Wouldn't it be more reasonable to say that there is both continuity and change? https://t.co/Eart9QotZl<span id='t7ZJlZR2V'/>

                                                    - Harari has a lengthy section arguing that the trend of history is towards ever-greater unity, and he cites things like inter-connection, globalization, mixing of cuisines.<span id='dRwBZVnbw'/>
                                                        - Here again he is one-sided and exaggerated. There are also many kinds of division and disconnection. https://t.co/3k0YAd6pt3<span id='0oD3kCcrU'/>

                                                        - In Sapiens, Harari does not give a role to geniuses or mega-agents, individuals who had a large impact on history.<span id='xVlfPlKGn'/>
                                                            - Constantine, without whom there would probably have been no spread of Christianity, is unmentioned. So is Ashoka, who ensured the spread of Buddhism.<span id='-bt-T01B_'/>
                                                            - Correction: Constantine is mentioned briefly. But the general importance of major agents is not at all a theme of the book.<span id='3Jlfi8WSX'/>
                                                                - Next: Harari's third big leap, the Scientific Revolution.<span id='x4K5baZ4M'/>

                                                                            - Wootton: https://logarithmichistory.wordpress.com/2019/11/10/steam-engine-time-4/ https://t.co/S7mV3UAzSq<span id='7AvR8Avgz'/>

It might have happened through Christianity or something else. There was a boom of eastern religions and a decline of Greco-Roman cults.<span id='iJoakRDHb'/>
                                                                - **Lazy Glossophiliac**: Monotheism won because it was intolerant. Some forms still are.

                                                - **Tony Morley II**: Caloric surplus is the prerequisite of settlement - without a surplus of foodstuffs, specialisation is precluded. Without specialisation, advanced trade, technology and craft manufacturing is precluded. Primitive #agriculture kicked off civilization. üåæüçûüêêü•õüêÇü•© #HumanProgress<span id='MWv2YL3BT'/>

                                        - **Shift Lant**: Wouldn't it also imply a genetic change?<span id='70l8yJC7L'/>
                                        - **Reid Albecker**: "Plants domesticated Homo sapiens" is a comment meaning agriculture changed the cultures of of the people who adopted it.<span id='raUEheDuW'/>
                                    - **Lazy Glossophiliac**: This seems like a terrible book. The agicultural revolution made civilization possible.<span id='wJW5JGc0Z'/>
                                        - **Jan Minar ‚ù§Ô∏è**: Civilization is like Democracy -- we all know it's a really good thing, because it pays for its own PR.<span id='NRqHVfrln'/>
                                    - **Jan Minar ‚ù§Ô∏è**: Settled agriculture allowed the hunter-gatherer elite to farm their less genetically endowed relatives like cattle (along with animal cattle &amp; plants). The elite always had existed -- those who survived the astronomical death rates of the hunter-gatherer society.<span id='EzC_YiZkm'/>
                                        - **Jan Minar ‚ù§Ô∏è**: To make the argument that humankind suffered by the ag revolution, you would have to show that the number of people who are free and elite and what have you was decreased by it. Which is obviously not so.<span id='9iFeX0Nof'/>
                                    - **Mats Vinnaren**: Neither of these dudes are rigid *scientific* intellectuals. As wonderfully written &amp; pieced together their hyped magnum opuses are, they are too inaccurate, incorrect, &amp; deficient descriptions of reality; of historical &amp;  societal phenomena w/ strong biological causes.<span id='mIPY7uFDQ'/>
                                - **Cameron Harwick üèõ**: This was actually the reason I liked the book so much more than everyone else seems to. Myth and norms aren't separate explanations; in fact I'd say myth is an essential component of most norms. I thought Harari's discussion of this point was excellent for a pop sci book.<span id='JElBQdH_q'/>
                                    - He uses the example of Peugeot and its lion symbol as a fiction. But how is that organization based on a myth?<span id='is5oU3cNe'/>
                                    - **Cameron Harwick üèõ**: Miller (1992) models "company culture" as a myth-like sort of thing that overcomes shirking problems within firms. Anthropologically, it's not insignificant that meaning-laden symbols (like the Peugeot lion) coordinate altruistic behavior in humans. https://t.co/yIcW8TudvL<span id='Pa9ejADLt'/>

                                    - **Cameron Harwick üèõ**: Reading back over that section in Harari, I'll grant the connection is sketchy there. The legal fiction point seems like an overly specific instance of how humans use symbols to elicit buy-in against what would otherwise be our individual best interests.<span id='OKHeC-llC'/>
                                - **Reid Albecker**: Not a departure from the gist of the "social imaginary" construct, which is consistent with Harari's writing and does not discount norms/rules/laws. Increases in a culture's knowledge can be facilitated as a result. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_(sociology);<span id='UmrVgmZ5p'/>

                                        - There was the Original Event that created modern language (hence fiction).<span id='_MXgJdW_k'/>
                                - **SHUTUP!**: What about spoken language? Is that not the strongest social glue of them all? NEXT‚ÄºÔ∏è<span id='V-qqC6sIp'/>

                                    - **SHUTUP!**: I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre saying. But I‚Äôm saying speech was the primary social behavior that allowed humans to cooperate and ultimately dominate earth. Not mythology, fiction, or even knowledge. Those are all secondary. Idk why the author focuses on myth<span id='TKf1ifnjf'/>
                                - **Soulsweller**: No, he is pretty spot on about this. You're interpreting him too literally: he uses fiction as a synonim for what has traditionally been referred to as symbolic thought.<span id='oc_kmmQ01'/>
                            - **Seth Abrutyn**: Nonsense.<span id='6nDDdBMmJ'/>
                            - **Jan Minar ‚ù§Ô∏è**: Shared mythology allows people to synchronize their norms, without litigating what those norms ought to be every time something needs to be done.<span id='nds7h4l0p'/>
                                - No other social technology can do this, so our ability to have myths must have been the start of history as we know it, QED.<span id='ztrT6i4PT'/>
                                - **Jan Minar ‚ù§Ô∏è**: Myths not in the sense of entertainment-level narratives, but in the sense of narratives people believe so deeply they are not even necessarily consciously aware of it.<span id='ABHBV524q'/>
                                    - How do we know they exist then?<span id='EZSBf0ctq'/>
                                        - I don't deny that myths exist and that they *can* prompt people to act together; what I do deny is that they always do so and are the basis of all collaboration<span id='oKn9cpC5O'/>
                                            - **Jan Minar ‚ù§Ô∏è**: What other social tech can supplant them?<span id='RlKB1Q2nu'/>
                                                - You have these massive nations several orders of magnitude above the Dunbar number, that instantly can co-operate across time and space.<span id='KdLmnYVCV'/>
                                            - I think variation in innate cooperativeness is more important than "social tech"<span id='4d4raL7RZ'/>
                                                - Japanese are more cooperative than Somalis, but not because they have myths.<span id='IuJpvXJaT'/>
                                        - **Jan Minar ‚ù§Ô∏è**: They are brought to stark relief whenever we live alongside people of a different mythology for a while, and reflect upon it. That's why people in their 20s should travel.<span id='5YRhjay0M'/>
                                - Maybe norms synchronize for a simpler reason: people tend to copy each other?<span id='MeQZYOTXc'/>
                                    - **Jan Minar ‚ù§Ô∏è**: For that you need empathy, i.e. theory of personality, i.e. you need to understand what the other person deeply believes. Shared meaningful experiences (the other part of religion: rituals) help syncing this, but myth is crucial in syncing the interpretation as well.<span id='s0G941ZfG'/>
                                    - **Jan Minar ‚ù§Ô∏è**: As a counter-point, go pick someone you know who has converted to a new religion -- you won't be able to understand anything about his new interpretation of the world at all.<span id='En6HhgsIa'/>
                                        - Myth is that technology via which we copy the norms.<span id='Pew4llxHe'/>
                        - **Seth Abrutyn**: Agreed on that last point. I remain skeptical of the agricultural revolution being 12000 years ago, when the plow hadn't been invented yet and really it was the end of the ice age and the slow onset of sedentary life. I would also argue the plow+writing (c. 5000 BP)...<span id='01hjR2WVu'/>
                            - **Seth Abrutyn**: were far more important than whatever he thinks happened 12000 yrs ago.<span id='HWk81XLhV'/>
                            - I'd like to see you expand on that idea sometime<span id='4ctn4tAgA'/>
                            - **Seth Abrutyn**: I will take you up on that. Maybe I'll write a quick blog post about it later this week or early next.<span id='UHUHf7-Yn'/>
                    - **Lazy Glossophiliac**: I think the earliest surviving statues and figures are from about 45k years ago. That seems like a more important point than 70k years ago.<span id='iXONczfmr'/>
                    - **Atlanto Celtica**: Just because there were modern humans living in Asia over 70kya doesn't mean they have any descendants living today.<span id='TfWP812FK'/>
                        - I hope find out soon. The way it goes is that they probably passed on some ancestry<span id='32AX6B2DX'/>
                - **Leandro Cardoso**: We are quite dumber as we usually think we are. We have culture and inter-generations passed info, but we alone, individually, are not able to solve simple problems like "reinvent" Euclidean Geometry if one is born wild in the jungle.<span id='ZD-C__u4n'/>
                    - **Leandro Cardoso**: I can handle some math tools like ODEs and some algebra, but I am quite sure I can not figure out alone how to catch a hare and make it a meal. If my "tribe" had teached me how to survive in the jungle, probably I would be unable to handle simple polynomial derivatives by myself<span id='jBjOIdzWh'/>
                - **Tim Rooney**: Potential reframe- brains were developed enough so you could take an infant and successfully raise it in our society<span id='Z2fGXq6HQ'/>

                    - This number was first proposed in the 1990s by British anthropologist **Robin Dunbar**, who found a correlation between primate brain size and average social group size.[3] **By using the average human brain size and extrapolating from the results of primates, he proposed that humans can comfortably maintain 150 stable relationships.**<span id='K_BgWG9EG'/>
                    - Primatologists have noted that, due to their highly social nature, primates must maintain personal contact with the other members of their social group, usually through social grooming. Such social groups function as protective cliques within the physical groups in which the primates live. The number of social group members a primate can track appears to be limited by the volume of the neocortex. This suggests that there is a species-specific index of the social group size, computable from the species' mean neocortical volume.[citation needed]<span id='HFmnrbpl-'/>
                    - In 1992,[1] Dunbar used the correlation observed for non-human primates to predict a social group size for humans. Using a regression equation on data for 38 primate genera, Dunbar predicted a human "mean group size" of 148 (casually rounded to 150), a result he considered exploratory due to the large error measure (a 95% confidence interval of 100 to 230).[1]<span id='Od-NDpQRA'/>
                    - Dunbar then compared this prediction with observable group sizes for humans. Beginning with the assumption that the current mean size of the human neocortex had developed about 250,000 years ago, during the Pleistocene, Dunbar searched the anthropological and ethnographical literature for census-like group size information for various hunter‚Äìgatherer societies, the closest existing approximations to how anthropology reconstructs the Pleistocene societies. Dunbar noted that the groups fell into three categories‚Äîsmall, medium and large, equivalent to bands, cultural lineage groups and tribes‚Äîwith respective size ranges of 30‚Äì50, 100‚Äì200 and 500‚Äì2500 members each.[citation needed]<span id='wZVbd_G-l'/>
                    - Dunbar's surveys of village and tribe sizes also appeared to approximate this predicted value, including 150 as the estimated size of a Neolithic farming village; 150 as the splitting point of Hutterite settlements; 200 as the upper bound on the number of academics in a discipline's sub-specialisation; 150 as the basic unit size of professional armies in Roman antiquity and in modern times since the 16th century; and notions of appropriate company size.[citation needed]<span id='GSGArxFTA'/>
                    - Dunbar has argued that 150 would be the mean group size only for communities with a very high incentive to remain together. For a group of this size to remain cohesive, Dunbar speculated that as much as 42% of the group's time would have to be devoted to social grooming. Correspondingly, only groups under intense survival pressure,[citation needed] such as subsistence villages, nomadic tribes, and historical military groupings, have, on average, achieved the 150-member mark. Moreover, Dunbar noted that such groups are almost always physically close: "[...] we might expect the upper limit on group size to depend on the degree of social dispersal. In dispersed societies, individuals will meet less often and will thus be less familiar with each other, so group sizes should be smaller in consequence." Thus, the 150-member group would occur only because of absolute necessity‚Äîdue to intense environmental and economic pressures.<span id='0fwqVy8z_'/>
                    - Dunbar, in Grooming, Gossip, and the Evolution of Language, proposes furthermore that language may have arisen as a "cheap" means of social grooming, allowing early humans to maintain social cohesion efficiently. Without language, Dunbar speculates, humans would have to expend nearly half their time on social grooming, which would have made productive, cooperative effort nearly impossible. Language may have allowed societies to remain cohesive, while reducing the need for physical and social intimacy.[9][10] This result is confirmed by the mathematical formulation of the social brain hypothesis, that showed that it is unlikely that increased brain size would have led to large groups without the kind of complex communication that only language allows.[11]<span id='xwup7VBpr'/>
