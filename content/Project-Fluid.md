- #public<span id='hE7S5Lo1_'/>
- So the basic idea is, this is so 2007. I'm, in my last year, my undergrad in International Development Studies in Toronto.<span id='yU2wB1n7o'/>
- And this was at the time before MOOCs, but after Open Courseware,<span id='CKwJPxLlS'/>
    - so you had 2 hour classroom recordings from MIT, but with Creative Commons licences,<span id='w63Xdc37B'/>
        - which is actually in some ways, much better than what we have today, sadly, but different, right.<span id='HBo3FTABe'/>
        - And, and these websites were 1.0, right? You couldn't log in or comment even if you wanted to.<span id='nA8g9_AIi'/>
- And I'm really interested in Creative Commons, open educational resources, how the open source kind of ethics and way of doing things, ideas can be applied to other domains<span id='rwDgh-OKF'/>
    - So the main idea was just like, here's a group that was very small scale.<span id='r-TsAajw-'/>
    - And so I'm at this conference in Croatia, an unconference on education.<span id='P4wsE8BLC'/>
        - So we're sitting around the circle, and I'm like, again, like last year of undergrad, I don't know anyone, like I'm reading people's blogs, I'm excited. But nobody knows my name. Nobody. I'm not in the community but I want to be. So I go to this conference.<span id='mca7no1l5'/>
        - And I'm, we're sitting around, they're like, **Well, why are you here?**<span id='o17Aj031o'/>
            - And I said, **I want to think about what the University of the future looks like. Without, you know, we don't need gym, we don't need the library. We don't need a lot of the things that we have right now. But there's still something that I think we do need. I want to figure out what that is and how we can provide it, you know, at scale.**<span id='WP7DP8hOb'/>
        - And then there's three or four others in the room who say **"I'm interested in that too"**.<span id='8oeIDX1xm'/>
            - And so the facilitator says okay, you four, there's a room right there, there's a whiteboard, you've got two hours. __And I'm so grateful to that facilitator__ who gave us that space – I've never seen them before I sat down.<span id='p1SO-ix1o'/>
                - One of them was **Philipp Schmidt**, who's now at the **MIT Media Lab**. I mean, all the others were a bit more senior, they're more connected than me.<span id='ms5vRz8a2'/>
                - But we basically sat down, we started thinking, and then you know, we started, we kept in touch. And eventually, what we said is, okay, **we have all this amazing material**.<span id='L6FlvU3ob'/>
                    - We have lecture videos, we have open access books, we have journal articles, we have Wikipedia, we have documentaries on YouTube.<span id='rKZeLB4TF'/>
                - So one thing we need is **to curate**,<span id='w1hGxbX40'/>
                    - we need someone to kind of say, hey, if you want to learn machine learning, like probably this is a good place to start.<span id='F5fY9LgeH'/>
                    - And don't just put machine learning in Google and click on the first five links, right.<span id='2Eiu49XT-'/>
                - And then we need **a learning group**.<span id='64R0o203e'/>
                    - We want someone to discuss with, **a cohort**,<span id='zUNUMAFNc'/>
                        - and someone called **Mike Caulfield** wrote this really nice blog post about the power of cohorts,<span id='ckJPNN8Hf'/>
                            - so you want someone to move through it with you together.<span id='JePBMSN9A'/>
                    - Then we talked about using different platforms, more problem based learning.<span id='9u-A6LPIK'/>
                        - Eventually, we developed this idea of **digital badges** with Mozilla and this idea of having challenges.<span id='HvRO3sI4Y'/>
                            - That's now blown up to be something huge, right? But we were actually on the ground floor of that, where that was actually developing kind of a web Academy with Mozilla. That never quite came to fruition.<span id='zcNyh1c9X'/>
        - And initially, we also have this idea of like, the long tail of courses.<span id='oYESuAGX-'/>
            - We launched in 2007. with seven courses,<span id='4IjE7Jgtq'/>
                - we found people who were interested in teaching or facilitating, and we had courses like,<span id='Y-7huVEJd'/>
                    - "learning game theory through poker", and, you know,<span id='haI1U8ibA'/>
                    - "reading science fiction"<span id='j0QboxgAv'/>
                - not productive basic courses<span id='WCq4q3XF7'/>
                    - Everyone does Econ 101, right.<span id='XSjUB8S4o'/>
                - Some of these people were like famous professors who were like "I could never teach this course. at my home institution, but I've always wanted to teach it".<span id='nBi3XdITO'/>
            - And so there's like a really cool group of people.<span id='uZhGz6dSk'/>
            - And we were experimenting with all kinds of different platforms.<span id='-FMSJWLo3'/>
                - We built our own crappy one,<span id='CphfHX-5f'/>
                - people using GitHub and blogs and aggregators.<span id='mKp4YQvk8'/>
        - It was a really nice community, in terms of **meta learning**, like<span id='m3NC9VJHD'/>
            - we're training people how to run courses,<span id='2heA_mlaF'/>
            - we're documenting it,<span id='FwQ9rcLPo'/>
            - we were doing workshops,<span id='jWCMmCA2i'/>
            - we got some money from Hewlett to actually do we yearly meetups.<span id='hOC41_49F'/>
                - So we have 2030 people from all around the world in Berlin, you know, hacking for a week,<span id='9lJl13xQa'/>
                    - it was the best time of my life.<span id='wCQ60Z33X'/>
    - And then a lot of different stuff happened.<span id='r1HG2M1Lf'/>
        - I'm not going to take you through the whole history.<span id='gpcTuxrnH'/>
        - Basically, we I think we kind of got scared by the MOOCs, and thinking like, oh, we're like they're taking over and we need to scale up<span id='RXm8Uz4tr'/>
            - which I was totally against.<span id='y9l8oaMUf'/>
        - I think there was this idea initially that this was supposed to be like for the disadvantages, like kind of Wikipedia style.<span id='6LUi_zH30'/>
            - We want to make education available to the world.<span id='9M83WeFkt'/>
            - And then we realised that, you know, the people are signing up for courses all have master's degrees and full jobs.<span id='U4Y4tjNY7'/>
                - and to me that was like, Yeah, but for years, people have been talking about the need for lifelong learning. And here we are providing this amazing lifelong learning for professionals. How is that a bad thing?<span id='LhT0QikhU'/>
                - Yes, I agree that there's all these unfilled needs, but do we have to do everything,<span id='gI_i0I2a5'/>
            - so we kind of pivoted<span id='sGiV78vpf'/>
                - first, they scaled way up, and they're like, okay, we're not gonna have cohorts, we're not gonna have quality control, we're just going to, like, let anyone create courses and, and we're going to have, you know, self paced and we kind of presaged the whole MOOCs transition.<span id='GrEqNFXTr'/>
                    - And we're gonna have badges that mean nothing like I filled in my name, I got a badge and so it collapsed,<span id='Dr3bHITO_'/>
                        - like there was nothing of value left basically.<span id='WUy_xFY3b'/>
                - After that they pivoted again<span id='nyI5L6tPn'/>
                    - now they're actually doing learning circles with libraries. To try to increase reach.<span id='lh5YPtJAv'/>
                        - And that I think is a really cool idea. But it's just doing something very different from what we were starting to do. And so they're really focused on "here's a 17 year old who didn't go to finish high school, how can we actually help them" – that's awesome.<span id='atBO-jUMU'/>
- But the amazing thing is I'm sitting in 2020. And I'm thinking like, **Hey, I really want to study Greek philosophy. And I really want to study neuroscience**, because<span id='g9vWPB3Ma'/>
    - after I left academia, my time horizon has radically expanded<span id='IVPhLppYo'/>
        - Like I'm following this course called [[Awakening From the Meaning Crisis]], which  really dives into all kinds of really interesting stuff.<span id='DQVX4m1mb'/>
            - I'm like, man, if I want to really understand what he's talking about, in terms of like, literally, Greek philosophy and neuroscience, palaeontology.<span id='oV23_fpdd'/>
                - That could take me 10 years.<span id='ZDXJu4G91'/>
                - Hmm. And I'm like,so **I should get started now, imagine how much I'll know in 10 years**,<span id='_NpZ4QpTt'/>
                - which is so different from my my reaction a year ago, right where I was in a postdoc, and I knew that I only had a year left before  I lost my job and I was applying and I had probably have to move to another country and stuff. So I was like, Okay, can I get a publication of this next six months?<span id='qpYDXxMrO'/>
- And **so I'm looking around and I'm thinking, hey, I want to learn with other people. **Right?<span id='DWnUWt99_'/>
    - I'm pretty self efficient learner, but I want to learn with other people.<span id='rYoczpzXp'/>
    - **And I realised that the need that we were trying to fulfil 13 years ago is still unfulfilled.**<span id='zRz3cyE_d'/>
- And so I've been talking to a bunch of people and **I have a concrete idea**.<span id='FYu_L7cdB'/>
    - So I have, I have a note in my system called [[E: Ad hoc book clubs]],<span id='eHnX4y0Bq'/>
        - like there's all these people on the internet.<span id='_7XskwEcK'/>
        - And I have all these articles I want to read.<span id='F69iW9TP8'/>
        - And I wish there was a platform where I could just say like, **hey, I want to read this article. Is there anyone else who wants to read our article and meet with me and we can talk about it?**<span id='_NvWMhK4n'/>
- And the point is, there's so many things that I want to read. And the order I read them in is somewhat arbitrary.<span id='BmpHyMgQo'/>
    - And so if I was on that forum, and I saw that, hey, Rob, is reading Doug Engelbart original essay. Do you want to read it with him?<span id='xjX6qgrP2'/>
        - I'm like, Yeah, I was gonna read that at some point. Right. But it would be cool to discuss it with Rob who I know and I'm connected with him on Twitter. I know he's a smart guy. So I'm going to read that now.<span id='6PKO9E2NN'/>
            - And also inspired by some of the stuff I've been seeing on Twitter, I figured that **a really simple MVP** of that<span id='0KevYOVWm'/>
                - you actually don't need any technology<span id='rkYZo430i'/>
                - you just like, **hey, anyone that wants to read something, like put your your name and your topic in a Google form, and I'm going to manually match people just to try it out**.<span id='r8E06P-ml'/>
- So that so that's how it started.<span id='OItOFPHHX'/>
- But as I've been talking to some people, with **Brian Tobal** we had this idea of getting his former I think university advisor and because we all stuck with larger groups like and you<span id='rtGuS0Hl7'/>
    - would you want a facilitator and would you be willing to pay 20 bucks to have like a professor facilitate reading group with really smart people?<span id='bspDbdrKl'/>
        - Yeah, I'd pay 20 bucks for that.<span id='TMhHvXvHB'/>
            - I'm in a different position now than when I was 18.<span id='GC7tB_PJF'/>
                - There are a lot of people out there who are willing to pay for newsletters, for really high quality content/interaction without wasting time.<span id='_4o5cBs1_'/>
    - But one of my concerns is, let's say we got four people together, who are interested in education, and we get some interesting deep article on education<span id='uZbVM9dr6'/>
        - that would already be awesome. It couldn't fail, kind of,<span id='4lniXx5kc'/>
        - But I fear that we would be spending so much time just kind of like ad libbing about like, "yeah, because when I was like doing this boot camp", "that's how we did at P2PU", "my friend told me about this new startup", etc.<span id='plBif_hAs'/>
            - which is super interesting, **but it's not really going into the depth of engaging with the material**.<span id='RYJkza97u'/>
        - And actually, that's the reason why you'd kind of want a sequence of papers because if you know that they've all read an article by Piaget, an article by Dewey and one by Vygotsky<span id='GbY5Df1vE'/>
            - We'd have more of a shared, understanding that now we can analyse a case together and maybe get more theoretical rigor<span id='lqir_nHrV'/>
- **when you're bringing people together for the first time, the depth that you can go is is pretty shallow. **<span id='7NK7_Jb3B'/>
    - It can be a really rewarding experience, it can be really enriching in that like, sort of community building sense, but the depth that you can go, you're not going be at the fronttier in meeting one, you've got to you've got to sort of get to like a level of shared understanding of that topic.<span id='QJwRuU9ct'/>
- So I'm taking you through my thinking here. You have this challenge.<span id='lXDtlvfNp'/>
    - But then of course, once you want people to sign up for a sequence, now you start worrying about like,<span id='_cyCkYJSA'/>
        - Oh, that's a big commitment.<span id='K0WMtjPSb'/>
        - The scheduling doesn't work for me.<span id='gNXkz8UN3'/>
        - I'm going to drop out,<span id='RwuPPhVBP'/>
            - what happens when everyone's dropping out?<span id='U8P9eGHxH'/>
    - Also, the thing is I really like one on ones.<span id='ZN74ND_NW'/>
        - Because I'm on so many meetings.<span id='pumqKyZsM'/>
            - Even in good meetings, I'm half the time on Twitter and stuff because whereas  now with you, I'm 100% engaged<span id='DZO8MO50N'/>
        - My PhD thesis was orchestrating a MOOC for 2000 teachers<span id='lw-wzn0AZ'/>
            - using all kinds of cool technologies and designs,<span id='QH8EASN7n'/>
            - and it was actually really cool.<span id='H4dVuHQbu'/>
                - So it is possible to create even large scale classes that are very meaningful, but it's quite complex<span id='7Z6tV-0lq'/>
        - whereas with a one on one, you get a lot for free<span id='yVWT08TXq'/>
    - So my idea was what if you have a community of people. So so then you say, Hey, you know, I'm really interested in reading Piaget.<span id='cp2lf2xd1'/>
        - But then what if there was a sequence that built on each other<span id='__BPf-Hai'/>
            - kind of like a skills graph,<span id='aQKTqIuTA'/>
        - where to be able to get something out of this, you need to read these three other papers.<span id='JB8kXeJ8j'/>
        - So I start by reading the Piaget paper with you<span id='7x9-4fZuA'/>
            - and the next time I'm setting up a meeting with someone I know that that the next person<span id='ps3WX6Xwl'/>
                - could be someone brand new, could also be you - depending on when people have time, how quickly they want to progress through the sequence<span id='BTDUmlrrk'/>
            - but I'll know that they've already read the Piaget article<span id='Ji_Kl14O6'/>
        - This could be whatever topic right?<span id='uM2yuRVoA'/>
            - And also this functions as kind of social proof because if I'm at the third level, I know that it's going to be at least someone who's like put in somewhat some effort.<span id='yz4jAL08Z'/>
        - And in fact, my idea would be to say,<span id='HO_kcIvgD'/>
            - you first read the paper,<span id='DvFrb_GEh'/>
            - then you write a little blog post about it.<span id='1kDW-P_Jh'/>
                - And this could be on the system, it could be on your own platform or whatever, Discourse or whatever.<span id='Gh8HbSIgn'/>
            - And then then you actually unlock access to the other person's blog post,<span id='6kPEjArPJ'/>
                - you read their blog post, and you comment on it<span id='LnV6UUzEw'/>
                    - and maybe there's some prompt<span id='sUHfgJ0Wj'/>
            - Then you'd meet for half an hour.<span id='qJyIvQt6y'/>
                - And now I think that discussion is gonna be so much richer because a you have social proof that you read it, because you wrote the blog post<span id='VVnctE0Re'/>
                    - You can't just come in like, oh, sorry, I just skimmed it on the way here, let's just chat<span id='8Jzc6JWPm'/>
                        - no, you can't actually start the meeting until you've written the blog post or something.<span id='NOubETFQr'/>
                    - And it's a conversation starter - you already know a lot about both the article and each other's ideas<span id='5W85s_dNW'/>
                        - and you're like, "Hey, I read your thing. I read that thing."<span id='5KjODAPZ7'/>
                            - And so you discuss<span id='wWpWTqGTX'/>
                            - maybe you're taking some notes together,<span id='tII9LAw85'/>
                                - but the idea is, at least you should come up with like **three main takeaways or three questions.**<span id='ntcObu_KF'/>
            - And so you've done the reading, you've done the blog post, you've read the other person's blog post, you've come up with three take-aways or three good questions<span id='Ddc_hDMOa'/>
                - and now you unlock access to everyone else's notes and questions from that same reading (previous cohorts/pairs)<span id='7bYvjPTCh'/>
                    - Because the thing I'm trying to balance here is on the one hand,<span id='bf2DYFGQm'/>
                        - **I think it's really valuable for people to try to figure stuff out from first principles**.<span id='p1jIH-jrR'/>
                            - So like if we just had the paper now by Piaget, instead of like, going and reading 50 critiques of Piaget, just like literally just reading the text, and thinking through it based on our own principles and experiences and stuff, and then discussing with other person I think is really valuable.<span id='9yqaXnalQ'/>
                            - But then once you do that, obviously, like, oh, here's someone who made a connection to, you know, barefoot schools in India, and here's someone who made a connection to the fireman academy and like, that's super enriching.<span id='8ncTInQBY'/>
                            - And it's also like this cool thing where you're building kind of a community knowledge base, but without having this problem where like, Initially writing on Wikipedia was actually a way of learning. Right? But now if you go to Wikipedia for most topics, you feel like you have nothing to add unless you're an expert. So right now you can you can learn by reading, but you can't learn by creating.<span id='-28De6Al7'/>
                                - Maybe you're we're even trying to crowdsource like,<span id='Fh_ziv-zS'/>
                                    - what is the best discussion prompt?<span id='IksR-XYoN'/>
                                    - Or what is the best blog question?<span id='U3TKM_3M5'/>
                                    - "So you read this article? Here's two different questions. Which one works better?"<span id='z4WMmUAaw'/>
                                    - Or "here's three discussion questions which one was the most useful to you?"<span id='Ei3swcafj'/>
                                    - Or maybe you do like an A B test on different groups<span id='83WVRX6kG'/>
                                        - depending on scale.<span id='vclusC08P'/>
                                    - maybe it's something around spaced repetition.<span id='HnwkhPn4_'/>
                                        - Andy Matuschak, in one of his podcasts talks about, like, crowdsourcing, even like collecting data from SRS questions around articles and being like this question has a better retention rate. But is that actually a good metric.<span id='9-B9mSzfQ'/>
