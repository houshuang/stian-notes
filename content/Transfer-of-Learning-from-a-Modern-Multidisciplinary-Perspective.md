- Introduction<span id='WWST-tLES'/>
    - Transfer is a term that describes a situation where information learned at one point in time influences performance on information encountered at a later point in time.<span id='MG2UaVebV'/>
    - **Harald Høffding** (1892)<span id='sVcBg_UON'/>
        - learning event `A`<span id='O0kCXWL5P'/>
        - stored internal representation when learned `a`<span id='YlJ95ln73'/>
        - internal representation of response to learned event `b`<span id='R8xzabWPs'/>
        - observable response `B`<span id='VSl6m_Wlb'/>
        - chain `A-a-b-B`<span id='nkOamdNfZ'/>
            - event `A` triggers `a` leads to `B`<span id='eJvyvb0rB'/>
        - what if you encounter `A'`? Will it still trigger `a`? How likely?<span id='Xl2SELsKD'/>
            - &#8203;<mark>Isn't it also about how `b` can be applied in a different way to a slightly different problem? You wouldn't want an identical response? #q</mark><span id='Zq6sE3e9C'/>

            - one learned event facilitates further learning<span id='8QSBgSkh0'/>

    - **Types of transfer**<span id='OnxlomVT-'/>
        - **Specific transfer**, **Near transfer** and **Literal Transfer** are similar<span id='rl5pI0Opj'/>

            - **Lateral Transfer**<span id='bauIR4PXQ'/>
                - skill or knowledge influences more complex skill or knowledge later - precursor<span id='rClwjTpK5'/>
                - instruction should be arranged to take advantage of hierarchical structure of knowledge to be learnt<span id='lajnIBmhb'/>

                        - move backwards until you encountered **entering behaviours**<span id='vAcf51CKx'/>
                            - skills students had acquired before entering school<span id='NmY4rwdpE'/>

            - **Nonspecific transfer**<span id='CASYYuWpe'/>
                - no obvious relationship, but acquisition of one influences the acquisition of the other<span id='1Gy_vLmLP'/>
                    - for example **learning to learn** (monkey experiments)<span id='9d2Bpnk8q'/>
