- Public link: https://roamresearch.com/#/app/stian-research/page/Aoq0x-csu<span id='YsATRjRBf'/>
- My concept of three levels (from **Roam meetup**)<span id='up0dcx3UL'/>
    - curious about note taking and knowledge organizing in social contexts - how to move across/between #[[Note taking]]<span id='qH1rneTOE'/>
        - individually - **Building a Second Brain** (**Tiago Forte**), [[Zettelkasten]] (Luhmann) etc<span id='kohE3ySLn'/>
            - journaling<span id='V2YUg-YiW'/>
            - common place books in the middle ages<span id='DMkv-kFQI'/>
            - Bullet Journaling<span id='srEBa5j59'/>
        - in small groups - **Marlene Scardamalia** and **Knowledge Building**/**Knowledge Forum**, a lot of **Computer Supported Collaborative Learning** in general, focusing on use of **wikis** in classrooms etc. **Group cognition**, **shared epistemic responsability**. "What does the group know?"<span id='qFSLMH_tW'/>
            - visualizations, **Knowledge Cartography** - **Issue Based Information System**<span id='54gElOzK6'/>
        - in networks - **Michael Nielsen**'s **Reinventing Discovery**, **George Siemens** and **Stephen Downes**' **Connectivism** for learning networks etc.<span id='x0Zw-vyAo'/>
    - But in addition, how does this interact with the design of artefacts<span id='JMGoSBFQD'/>
        - what does it mean for learning and teaching? A lot of texts about note taking etc focus on individual students in a traditional system, but how would you redesign the actual education experience around students "building second brains" etc?<span id='IX_eONeax'/>
            - example of the iversity MOOC on math (I think I have a blog post?)<span id='7UAa3y4bG'/>
        - what is the future of the **non-fiction book** etc?<span id='47jwWZj5E'/>
            - re Question about communication - compression and expansion/serialization (#narrative), like two amazing AIs who have to communicate through morse signals. Also link between note taking and cognitive structures - what does it mean to have learnt something?<span id='nHaqQY_7b'/><span id='CtCq5XgTb'/>
    - This tension between designing for certain interactions, and excluding other/narrowing the space<span id='jm4NVdyoP'/>
        - link to **over-scripting** and fading **scaffolding**?<span id='N4jVqCq4w'/>
        - also **Distributed cognition** - some things it's OK to always leave outside / **digital prosthesis**<span id='MWAXEu_iS'/>
        - **Dan Suthers** and **salience** (**suthers2008empirical**)<span id='6W94y2kaG'/>
- Granularity<span id='8vG_xmp3n'/>
    - Thinking about the framework of note taking across multiple dimensions also in terms of time, and granularity size.<span id='wn1ORYTwo'/>
        - I used to have theories of **granularity of collaboration**, and also **crowdsourcing**<span id='I2it-gqBi'/>
            - things like Wikipedia and **Yochai Benkler**.<span id='cQx3H-0Co'/>
            - And of course, it also connects to **collaborative writing**, and the research both on **live synchronous collaboration** and academic collaboration.<span id='qwx7aIdC6'/>
        - also curious about how people show off their knowledge processes.  #**Knowledge work showcase**<span id='2Lo2Nd7bH'/>
        - So sharing drafts and rounds of revisions from journals<span id='ndYukEeYf'/>
            - like the comparative education journals,<span id='25s3sREZl'/>
            - people showing their process like crafts, drawing and painting<span id='XNZAdWvpq'/>
                - the English portrait artist show,<span id='8gaNUPzzm'/>
            - although you cannot replicate the method, but it gives you a much deeper understanding because you see the layers and it might also help you better appreciate when you see things,<span id='Ea5dR4_m7'/>
                - both in terms of a painting to see the different layers and the processes,<span id='MzuiS-wpW'/>
                - but also for a chair for example, to see the **structural functional composition** maybe<span id='cla2_Zc1N'/>
                - and the way they felt about the design, the sketches.<span id='3o9rrEaH9'/>
            - Architects often publish books, about sketches. Are there any other disciplines<span id='aDEMsb4Xx'/>
            - The revision process of writing fiction or nonfiction, the research process.<span id='fWsIP7V8i'/>
                - There are not many people sharing their process. I would love to see<span id='oKz6ZTNst'/>
                - **Joel Chan**, **John Vervaeke**, **MIchael Nielsen**, **Andy Matuschak**.<span id='VuEPVZtg1'/>
                    - To not just hear them talk about it but actually see it<span id='Tv1fkz8DH'/>
                    - Of course, it's not as visual.<span id='6-2YKjFtI'/>
                    - But it could be, you could imagine a TV show<span id='AgNxBc_OS'/>
                        - the great English essay, where people are given a certain amount of time to do research and come up with policy recommendations for a topic.<span id='5JJkL3HfY'/>
                        - They know nothing about talking about research, finding sources, structuring them.<span id='uVvfzjW-D'/>
                    - There was some suggestion about this on Twitter, but it was more around debates and using different knowledge tools. Of course, many of these processes last for extremely long periods of time.<span id='UUBla3fDV'/>
