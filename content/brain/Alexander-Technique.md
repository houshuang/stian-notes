- Invented by **F. M. Alexander** - (1869-1955)**¬† an Australian actor<span id='nHZz_tTp-'/>

- Origin story<span id='1qnHSDVfi'/>
    - He began to experience chronic laryngitis whenever he performed Shakespeare<span id='FHNImqqvp'/>
        - context specific about speaking on stage<span id='nGVQnlHz7'/>
        - excess tension in neck and body<span id='9z01zfnZw'/>
    - Observed himself with mirrors from multiple angles<span id='saq5tx1BF'/>
    - Clearly wrong behaviour felt right - even when he tried to stop, he couldn't<span id='RHfxYNlH9'/>
        - Try as he might, whenever he started speaking as if on stage, his pattern of habits would kick in, outside of his conscious control.<span id='_12M_apPS'/>
- an educational process that brings the cessation of such<span id='Y3PaEj9Lb'/>
    - automatic habits<span id='VICwQEg54'/>
        - unhelpful and oftentimes damaging habitual patterns of being that have built up over the course of your life ‚Äì through no fault of your own besides a lack of awareness of this process happening.<span id='zc9cJp6uD'/>
            - Examples<span id='xT_OCK1C5'/>
                - You're a child at school. A teacher yells at you to 'pay attention'. What do you do?<span id='NrSWqHiUW'/>
                    - Try concentrating really hard without tightening any muscles in your face, particularly around your eyes, or without breathing any differently.<span id='e9b8IbqVl'/>
                        - Muscular effects of concentration<span id='lXUPgeZcN'/>
                            - **Lulie**: I've always found it strange that people furrow their brow when they are thinking. It reads as pain. As if concentrating isn't nice.<span id='uHM5Rp9ph'/>
                                - I think my face gets *more* relaxed when concentrating. (Possible exception: when drawing a tensed face.) Breath may still slow/pause though.<span id='MTBXPAf84'/>
                                    - Interestingly the "why do you frown when you think?" challenge often triggers defensiveness.<span id='knrgXjsYv'/>
                                - The breathing one is interesting - I suspect that again most do that without realising it.<span id='yD17SDVhp'/>
                                    - **Lulie**: Pausing breathing while drawing may simply be to reduce movement and stabilise the pencil. (One is explicitly taught to hold one's breath when taking a photo without a tripod ‚Äî same principle.)<span id='W_-ndKFRy'/>
                                        - But it seems broader. Not sure this is true, but interesting: https://web.archive.org/web/20160104211733/http://www.winwenger.com/ebooks/guaran3.htm<span id='zUh-rZcY3'/>
                    - You respond with muscles. You furrow your brow, you sit up more straight. You're anxious so your breathing becomes shallow.<span id='V5i4rKAo8'/>
                    - What do muscles have to do with attention?<span id='F6lZo9Fvj'/>
                - It's your early teens and the idea of 'cool' enters your mind. You want to look cool, perhaps a cool walk? How does a cool person walk?<span id='_eUt1QSGn'/>
                    - Your conscious mind intervenes in your walking.** 'You' start 'doing' walking, where before it was natural.**<span id='ZxwdVOX76'/>
                    - A new habit is formed.<span id='4QpHVxzUV'/>
            - We have endless internal stimuli that trigger this kind of 'unnatural' habitual behaviour.<span id='8waGWSBOV'/>
                - We walk, sit, stand, talk and breathe in the suboptimal ways our conscious minds once learned to do these things.<span id='FR853rIWc'/>
    - into conscious control.<span id='2GBMscWy8'/>
        - Your system knows how to walk, sit, stand, talk and breathe without 'you' getting involved.<span id='i2brSgzsU'/>
            - "If you stop doing the wrong thing the right thing does itself" ‚Äì F.M. Alexander<span id='O0V-TnRjN'/>
        - In the world of AT this is called '**inhibition**',<span id='6apa-xkzk'/>
            - the skill to widen the space between stimulus and response ‚Äì a path to freedom.<span id='J-Z2RnGtU'/>
            - which pre-dates Freud's use of the word.<span id='AOFuP1-Ox'/>
            - ‚ÄúBetween **stimulus and response** there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.‚Äù ‚Äì **Viktor Frankl**<span id='z9m8wtsf4'/>
                - **üçï**: Love this quote. I have used the (self-discovered, I thought!) technique of "intentionally inserting myself" into that space to great effect. My view on what about myself is "nature" and what "nurture" has shifted dramatically because of this practice üëçüèª<span id='ItfElS5qQ'/>
            - Inhibition is a momentary thought that precedes the action itself, in order for the movement to occur with less muscular interference in the body. Inhibition is a pause to allow for a change in the approach to an action. Imagine that you are craning your head and neck forward to see the computer screen, with your shoulders lifted and tension in your neck. Instead of just pulling your shoulders down (merely tightening other muscles around the shoulder blades), allow for a moment of pause or nondoing. Let your breathing become apparent. You may sense the body naturally releasing tension around the neck and this in turn invites you to bring the head, neck, and shoulders into a place of reduced strain.<span id='GXhFdei40'/>
        - I have a theory here inspired by **Alan Watts**.<span id='CTyACuPp6'/>
            - "It's a chronic habitual sense of muscular strain which we were taught in the whole process of doing spontaneous things to order." [6:30]<span id='CRuHDVLaW'/>
            - The effect of Alexander Technique is to undo all of that.<span id='UF65CFo_H'/>
                - As we loosen the grip of the chronic muscular pushes and pulls of "I', we in turn loosen the grip of the "I" itself.<span id='6Q_JtP-0R'/>
                - This is why I think AT is so profound and why I'm keen to share this perspective on it.<span id='Yva40-xec'/>
- State of consciousness<span id='X7HBnxUTj'/>
    - This can feel...strange.<span id='p3iqtO0XZ'/>
        - You catch a ball flawlessly, elegantly and with no effort, but it's like you watch it happen. You set an intention to catch the ball and your hand and arm just reach out, perfectly. #**holding an intention**<span id='G2f8xdWKh'/>
        - When we enter such a state naturally we call it "beginners' luck".<span id='lS246OVA-'/>
    - There's a particular state of consciousness that comes about through practice of Alexander Technique ‚Äì a kind of very pleasant, wide open three dimensional spatial awareness.<span id='LeAx6uZG1'/>
        - We use similar language to that used in **Zen**. The barriers between Self and the world break down.<span id='oPNT1Yc8c'/>
- Link with other theories/frameworks<span id='j6SGaa--Z'/>
    - potential connections to **Iain McGilchrist**'s **brain hemisphere model**, sort of a "walking on the right side of the brain" parallel to the book "**Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain**" (h/t **Sarah McManus**)<span id='3OXY-VbPn'/>
    - For those familiar with **Taoism**, such spontaneous action may sound familiar as **wu wei**.<span id='lWGwDcQM3'/>
        - Alexander Technique, then, is a 'western' framework in which to explore and cultivate non-doing.<span id='pl4bovNT6'/>
