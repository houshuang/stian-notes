- **Log**<span id='bUnIclJ0o'/>
    - Finished Intro **March 25th, 2020**<span id='R9dSzJ7iJ'/>
    - Next is Productivity<span id='bE1o9c9iH'/>
    - {{**TODO**}} Quick email to **Nat Eliason** when I finish the course with some thoughts/suggestions. IN general, he uses a lot of manual processes. Would be interesting to directly juxtapose different approaches.<span id='3VmFyeUn4'/>
- Questions:<span id='bDLDnuma3'/>
    - {{query: {and: {**q** **Nat Eliason's Roam Course**}}}<span id='-WOiLi4FX'/>
- Notes<span id='jIeFxkB6_'/>
    - Formatting<span id='4HbLjry7-'/>
        - cmd+alt+1 for headlines<span id='ypnbRX2Ze'/>
    - Hides future tasks under a bullet "Future Notes", which lets you quickly hide them<span id='rGR7c-YVX'/>
    - Metadata on book database leads to nice filtering<span id='5xDzpWCwF'/>
    - #q Can you create a query that automatically shows TODOs without a date, without having to manually mark them as such?<span id='q_GNdjMt6'/>
    - Metadata<span id='7Y0bUm1Jk'/>
        - starts a new page with writing Metadata::, shift+click, and seeing all of his metadata tags, copying a certain kind (like article), and quickly having access to the most important things - let's you filter later<span id='W4FsvWQuZ'/>
        - Problem with this kind of metadata is that it's not nested or tied to book contents, so cannot filter etc. There was a discussion about that somewhere?<span id='UZGkbRzPg'/>
    - Capture<span id='KA8vgOzNy'/>
        - Using **Drafts** for quick notes<span id='OZgNQZEo3'/>
        - Getting articles in<span id='4le94ckww'/>
            - using **Instapaper** with **Readwise** and **Evernote** integration, with metadata using text expander. Lot's of manual work though<span id='1TWY185wo'/>
            - Regular time every week to empty **Instapaper** queue and process. Good idea.<span id='sbATVV2VH'/>
            - xrm is a nice text expander tag<span id='BFan4SKmV'/>
            - **Readwise** has an app that let's you take pictures and highlight in physical books as well<span id='D2zBDdZ6A'/>
        - **Progressive summarization**<span id='fLh4xTlx_'/>
            - pasting clippings into Roam<span id='t1MdA_V89'/>
            - first pass, bolding and linking concepts<span id='kWOQvuTLw'/>
            - second pass, some more bolding, and highlighting<span id='9DJ1DeXhK'/>
            - third pass, create Notes and Summary headers (in H1), write quick summary, and hide notes<span id='kW2fq5WgH'/>
            - contextual links in notes means that this article still surfaces in very specific contexts<span id='Uc5is4FWs'/>
        - Adapting **How to take smart notes**<span id='N5KBYMm_B'/>
            - Has switched to reading more physical books instead of Kindle<span id='niKcDnZo_'/>
            - Uses book tabs to keep track of interesting ideas which he captures using **Readwise** app<span id='qIAyNyw6b'/>
            - Also has a notebook alongside while reading<span id='hgQiFQbZH'/>
            - Pull out ideas quickly after reading the book, because the notes might be very rough and rely on your memory<span id='emA7QgAVo'/>
            - Uses **Sublime Text** to add a tag for that book to the end of each idea<span id='kf7_oiA7t'/>
                - #q Why not just nest them under the tag? Because he's going to move them to other pages. Why not reference?<span id='5V_y7TRDB'/>
            - Notes should live in the most important context, not necessarily where they came from... So he manually opens pages on key concepts, like Cash Flow, and drags the note there. Why not just tag it and use mentions?<span id='0geM-zIkU'/>
        - Organize your notes into **Head Pages**<span id='nfD3Cc6-7'/>
            - relevant to **Note consolidation**<span id='Vo8skD5--'/>
            - looking through the mentions, opening a lot of them in the sidebar (and taking advantage of the **Progressive summarization** he has already done), organizing key ideas, liberally alt-dragging snippets.<span id='63vVLD87d'/>
            - #q Part of the problem is how do you deal with your mentions growing over time - there isn't a good way to mark them as done? Can you tag them and then filter them away if you've processed them (problem is a block that links to multiple concepts). With block referencing, the specific block gets marked, but that might not be visible on the mention...<span id='Vc3dinsnd'/>
            - His approach is informed by his use of tags on articles - so his mentions are much less likely to link directly to content, instead he just uses them to identify relevant articles, and then look through the articles in the sidebar. My use of tags is a bit different.<span id='Ki4MFmhid'/>
            - Sometimes a bullet can grow to become its own page<span id='pzCubr4G3'/>
        - Video notes<span id='gwc-Gfqzj'/>
            - Watching video directly in Roam using the video tag, and taking notes.<span id='tybJjKK0H'/>
                - would be neat if Roam had a fancier interface, like letting you link notes directly to time stamps, split-view, keyboard control for playback etc. #roam-feature<span id='eqqPBQRUA'/>
                - he doesn't take any screenshots, but keeps time codes #suggestion<span id='gX9krijJ2'/>
        - Drafting<span id='6IS2bj3EA'/>
            - Create a new bullet to hold the draft (distinguish from other notes)<span id='cIN35PBI0'/>
            - Use document view<span id='_BiC8dOLz'/>
            - Zoom in on specific sections you are in the process of writing<span id='8boRK9WcU'/>
            - Open sources in sidebar and alt-drag to quote things<span id='KeV_zHwPU'/>
            - Uses { {word-count}} in the section title to keep track<span id='ZBVup8Kp6'/>
            - Manually copies over each section to a Google Doc for final editing<span id='zd8psUgad'/>
        - **Newsletter-writing**<span id='vdDd9WrfS'/>
            - tagging things for a specific newsletter<span id='j5ih8DFFk'/>
            - adding done tag when he has included it in the newsletter outline<span id='aClNmtT4G'/>
            - often shift+clicking on newsletter tag and directly doing writeup in the sidebar, while the article page is open in the main pane<span id='iV0P8P6tP'/>
