        - **there is no such thing as a commodity**<span id='s7JmmPlV3'/>
        - __Levitt argues that anything, including a commodity, can be differentiated when it is sold. Write down Levitt's definition of a product in your own words. Also, be sure you can explain the differences amongst: the generic product, the expected product, the augmented product, and the potential product.__<span id='i3uojqC5K'/>

            - Four essential goals<span id='pydXfZFNr'/>
                - Yearn for paradise, driven by our quest for freedom<span id='Kh6aJU-sV'/>
                - Make our mark, driven by our ego<span id='RBG-9aAZ8'/>
                - Connect with others, driven by social desire, comfort, and emotional connection<span id='AQCcO4JvQ'/>
                - Provide structure to the world, driven by a need for rules and order<span id='4FYOa3Y-r'/>
            - 12 main archetypes.<span id='iYWgD5JbT'/>
                - **Innocent: **The Innocent is the one sharing optimistic quotes on Instagram. They’re romantics, dreamers, and they ache for the traditional and nostalgic. Brand example: Little Debbie exemplifies nostalgia to the core with their name and iconic 1950s packaging.<span id='wQ3wbmdSV'/>
                - **Sage: **The Sage hunts for the truth and believes in self-reflection. Hungry for knowledge in all its forms, they’re detectives, scholars, academics, philosophers, thinkers, and data junkies. Brand examples: Harvard, Stanford, and Cambridge Universities (and research facilities) epitomize the perennial student and information-seekers.<span id='_m8e6jDrr'/>
                - **Explorer: **The Explorer eschews boundaries and limits. Don’t ever box them in. They’re nonconformists, iconoclasts, nomads, and pilgrims. Brand example: Harley Davidson attracts older men with sleeve tattoos as well as millennial weekend warriors. At the core of their brand promise is freedom—their customers can go wherever they want, whenever they want.<span id='d-WNxr2a1'/>
                - **Outlaw: **The Outlaw wants to fight the system. They’re rule-breakers and misfits who want to disrupt, shock, and destroy the status quo. Brand example: When Apple launched iTunes, iPods, and iPhones, they revolutionized how people purchase, collect, and listen to music; they transformed the phone into a pocket computer.<span id='fcEL4F47V'/>
                - **Magician: **The Magician is about making magic happen. They’re charismatic visionaries who make their wildest dreams a reality. The magician is an inventor, healer, doctor, creator, and transformer. Brand example: Disney embodies a world where we frolic alongside princesses and cute mice.<span id='kqXqqiE4r'/>
                - **Hero:** The Hero’s uniform is a cape, and they’re always up for a challenge. They’re fearless, strong, competent, and agile. They’re on the front lines as warriors, superheroes, and soldiers. Brand examples: Marvel and the U.S. Army represent our imaginary and real heroes.<span id='RthUmUXDJ'/>
                - **Lover: **The Lover is all about intimacy, relationships, passion, and compassion. They’re partners, friends, team-builders, support staff, and sensualists. Brand examples: Agent Provocateur, Victoria’s Secret, and Hershey’s Kisses all quicken and warm hearts.<span id='N7nLwCglu'/>
                - **Jester: **The Jester is the joker, the kind of person living their best life right now. Their goal is to get you to giggle by any means necessary. They’re comedians and pranksters. Brand example: Wendy’s annual Twitter roast made people laugh, cry, or a combination of both.<span id='KrC-3KQnS'/>
                - **Every Person:** The Every Person is the one you want to grab a beer with. Pretension-free, they have solid values, are free of artificial sweeteners, and serve as a relatable neighbor. Like Patrick Bateman said in __American Psycho__, they want to “fit in.” Brand example: Dunkin Donuts, whose tagline is “American runs on Dunkin.” It’s coffee for the everyday person on the go.<span id='lrjgOPftJ'/>
                - **Caregiver: **The Caregiver is altruistic, generous, kind, and empathetic. They believe in a life of serving others, nurturing others, and as a result, they elicit consumer trust. Brand examples: World Wide Fund for Nature, Greenpeace, and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital all exude selflessness.<span id='ajNo741UK'/>
                - **Ruler: **The Ruler wants to crush the competition. They’re powerful leaders who believe in winning as the ultimate goal. They’re role models, leaders, aristocrats, and politicians. Brand example: Tesla is a leader in the luxury car market.<span id='1P9K1xKlv'/>
                - **Creator: **The Creator is the artist with a boundless imagination. They’re visionaries who use their skills and talents to represent the world in a new, unique way. They hunger for innovation, creativity, and perfection. While both Creators and Magicians inspire imagination, Creators dig in tactically to create covet-worthy products. Brand examples: Crayola and LEGO are prime examples of Creators.<span id='ODrsSXquA'/>
