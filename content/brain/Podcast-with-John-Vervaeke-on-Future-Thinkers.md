- **My questions:**<span id='TaL7LjwuX'/>
    - {{query: {and: [[Podcast with **John Vervaeke** on **Future Thinkers**]] **q**}}}<span id='zof1M_Rq6'/>
- **The meaning crisis**<span id='6QubjLUb-'/>
    - The **death of religion**, scientific world view is not really aligning with who we think we are<span id='hdIZDR6LH'/>
        - **depression**<span id='5OKHUwvCs'/>
        - **drug abuse**<span id='iiS3Huc3a'/>
            - There's a new theory that it's not purely chemical, but it's a **reciprocal narrowing**, that you're seeing fewer choices and fewer opportunities. And so, I guess it's linked to **hopelessness** that **Doug Tataryn** talked to in the **Bio-emotive framework**.<span id='JJBL2wMrW'/>
            - [Understanding Addiction](https://www.memoirsofanaddictedbrain.com/), the website of neuroscientist Mark Lewis<span id='SEKwQufQI'/>
        - **suicide**<span id='GQzB-bcWz'/>
    - People are turning to **mindfulness**, **stoicism**, philosophy, but most people are **autodidact**. And it's very easy to continue with **self-deception**. The Internet kind of amplifies this gives you these **echo bubbles**.<span id='1-OWpsyMe'/>
        - He says that 40% of people have some kind of insight, **mystical experience**. But without a grounded framework, they cannot really interpret it. And so, having **religion**, any kind of religion, helps with that<span id='ZS0IgZJse'/>
    - What you need is<span id='tDrhgXPY8'/>
        - **mindfulness**.<span id='rS4S-HYYE'/>
            - talks a lot about **zooming in and zooming out** or raising and lowering. (concept from **Shinzen Young**)<span id='2oZ6ckA2b'/>
            - **zooming in**<span id='G8aJaiU5O'/>
                - You need insight into yourself and your own processes.<span id='2Ir8UEHDm'/>
            - **zooming out**<span id='B8sDJ_6JO'/>
                - But then you need to see the world and see if you can see the world differently. (Like polishing glasses, and then looking through them)<span id='8PGAv_onA'/>
            - has also done a lot of **cognitive research**, which is trying to reinvent mindfulness and which is coming to a lot of the same results.<span id='ZrQy6E39m'/>
            - Is very critical of the way mindfulness has been used in the West, because it is not as it's taken out of the context. So, Buddha has **the eight paths**, and one of them is meditation, but it's apparently good meditation. distinguishing it from other kinds of meditation. #Meditation<span id='LMc_dzey2'/>
            - Look at [The Kyoto School of Philosophy](https://thekyotoschoolofphilosophy.wordpress.com/)<span id='mHmiFtBFu'/>
        - You need to integrate with the body. So dance or movement. #embodiment<span id='p3Ys5mAog'/>
        - You need **rationality**,<span id='STJ-53eXv'/>
            - but rationality is much more than biases. It's really about self deception. So **cognitive behavioral therapy** and **mindfulness** and a way of dialogue that is not combative and not trying to win or prove a point. #Conversation<span id='6dLzNB9ki'/>
- **Scarcity mindset**<span id='7J3GSJtUv'/>
    - some people who are doing their course, keep grasping on to new meaning frameworks, and then the other people have to kind of take that apart and crush it for them to be able to move on.<span id='p3yphTRwZ'/>
    - This is an example of scarcity mindset,<span id='mUBB4ctFz'/>
        - when you're so thirsting for meaning, anything that you come across, you kind of stick with it.<span id='6x-vsxM0T'/>
        - Talks a lot about the process, that it's not about the goal. It's not about arriving somewhere, but it's about continually trusting the process of progressing.<span id='sj6dSZiNO'/>
    - What we need more is **playfulness**<span id='erskKOyjB'/>
        - how kids plays that they find a solution that works, and then they introduce all kinds of different variations of that and explore it,<span id='TANxSO7ar'/>
        - in our society, we don't really have a space for **serious play**.<span id='tKBt6y69R'/>
            - It's either, really trivialized or it becomes work.<span id='7pDF6ZsV4'/>
            - And he says that religion provided a space for this<span id='QyzoDsS-v'/>
                - &#8203;<mark>What is the relationship between **serious play** and **religion**? #q</mark><span id='elkl5AIR2'/>
                - &#8203;<mark>How does his desire for **playfulness** link to things Montessori and other pedagogical approaches #q</mark><span id='Ez3WQWuZw'/>
- **Truth and love**<span id='2Yq6_ZUI5'/>
    - **reciprocal widening** and **reciprocal knowing** where you know the thing and you know yourself. And there's also **participatory knowing** where you have this exploration of opening up to someone else, and then opening up to you and that is **love**.<span id='6bA-Tn7zC'/>
        - reference to There's a new theory that it's not purely chemical, but it's a **reciprocal narrowing**, that you're seeing fewer choices and fewer opportunities. And so, I guess it's linked to **hopelessness** that **Doug Tataryn** talked to in the **Bio-emotive framework**.<span id='JJBL2wMrW'/><span id='XHNKsbq42'/>
        - Apparently in the Hebrew tradition, knowing his loving.<span id='7QC6KlYFN'/>
        - **Metta** and **agape** ??<span id='3c7E7AlAJ'/>
        - Sympathy is not pity.<span id='v3LJ-dodE'/>
        - Talks a lot about **Socrates**<span id='hOfDLXj3r'/>
- **Framing** and **information overload**<span id='0atMgt5me'/>
    - We are receiving incredible amounts of information that we cannot process.<span id='ORDXBE-Mk'/>
    - We cannot do an exhaustive search of all possibilities, so we're constantly selecting information and framing<span id='sk0qPpyEp'/>
        - this is why it's **a process**, because we can never **focus** on all things- it's a process of getting deeper.<span id='S-qZwrMXF'/>
        - &#8203;<mark>I'm curious about things like art, or music, beautiful things. Is there a different function to aesthetics than to politically meaningful art?</mark> #q<span id='Xfzb6dac7'/>
        - &#8203;<mark>He has not said almost anything about the way society should be organized, about suffering (**dukha**) or service.</mark>  #q<span id='nSKxqy2x1'/>
- **Exaptation**<span id='TObywJhjT'/>
    - when something that developed for a certain purpose is used by someone for something else.<span id='g3pd86_yo'/>
    - Ex: the tongue was developed to taste poison, apparently, and was exempted for speech.<span id='J_PJkJ-0P'/>
    - He thinks that the mechanism for insight is being exapted for things like **flow** which is like **a cascade of insights** (he has a paper on that) and for kind  mystical experiences<span id='z4Y-kyUZF'/>
- **Autonomic nervous system**<span id='jhT7jZbTY'/>
    - __So there's the **sympathetic**, which is looking for reasons to get excited, or worried or high level and **parasympathetic**, which is pushing in the other direction. But so there it's a **self organizing system of agents**. And they're trying to optimize the right so they're working towards the same goal. It's not  an adversarial relationship. __<span id='echrNU0DN'/>
    - From other sources<span id='_yaCkhcX1'/>
        - __The **autonomic nervous system** is a control **system** that acts largely unconsciously and regulates bodily functions such as the heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, pupillary response, urination, and sexual arousal__ ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system))<span id='Aiaq_KrVr'/>
        - The **parasympathetic nervous system (PNS)** controls homeostasis and the body at rest and is responsible for the body's "rest and digest" function. The **sympathetic nervous system (SNS)** controls the body's responses to a perceived threat and is responsible for the "fight or flight" response.

- Using **psychedelics**<span id='ptL0ZByzG'/>
    - effects<span id='PKHbegl4w'/>
        - introduces noise into the machine<span id='IN81v4oZ6'/>
        - disassociates from reality<span id='1gmFPjhvQ'/>
    - can be very useful if you're properly trained,<span id='PqXmbNiKG'/>
    - but it can be dangerous if you are not<span id='YAa-0N8rL'/>
        - so maybe the government should not prohibit drugs, but there should be a licensing to go through some kind of course.<span id='FsLBZEzCj'/>
    - **Machine learning** introducing some noise avoids **overfitting** or to early **local optima**.<span id='5B3-WuymR'/>
        - The same can be true for **insight generation**.<span id='bG59JSeQj'/>
            - Even shaking the screen or lower levels of disturbance can help generate more insights<span id='FyqdZYBhq'/>
- The difference between **lying** and **bullshit**<span id='GYBnJ2r0y'/>
    - Lying has an epistemic component. And **you can't lie to yourself. **<span id='-lWD98Gcw'/>
    - But **you can bullshit yourself**.<span id='1dwuItJHo'/>
    - Seminal philosophical book about bullshit which he has expanded upon.<span id='GOXuMiocL'/>
    - **salience** and **attention**.<span id='CbOOrLxBD'/>
        - With bullshit we can make people **not pay attention to truth**.<span id='3ISY1EdCn'/>
        - You can make something salient by like a loud noise or sexy people.<span id='-uWBRzHNO'/>
        - You can also be explicit about directing attention, like saying, "think about your right toe right now".<span id='SNfJiaLLB'/>
