- about **John Seely Brown**, **Design Unbound** and **Insight through making** about **design**<span id='72TDZZTeo'/>
- starts a daily note, hierarchical bullets but also normal text. Making new pages and clicking on them. **Bear**<span id='utz-yT8fF'/>
- taking notes from the book - not clear if he has already taken notes while reading the book, or if he is just talking from memory and flipping through the book while taking notes<span id='Ap3nHofrX'/>
- Initially adding a bunch of concepts, and then indenting under, saying "I will separate these out into different notes later"<span id='vbCr44Aek'/>
- [[types of **reasoning**]] / thinking<span id='Fi39nVt4n'/>
    - **synthetic**<span id='VZoJuVJOz'/>
        - **syntopic**<span id='zyHc5Y2YZ'/>
    - **abductive**<span id='wRNoozB9h'/>
        - **Abductive** reasoning (also called abduction, **abductive** inference, or retroduction) is a form of logical inference that starts with an observation or set of observations and then seeks to find the simplest and most likely conclusion from the observations. #**Occam's razor**? **designerly thinking**?<span id='L9PVMORKy'/>
        - Despite many possible explanations for any physical process that we observe, we tend to abduce a single explanation (or a few explanations) for this process in the expectation that we can better orient ourselves in our surroundings and disregard some possibilities. Properly used, abductive reasoning can be a useful source of **Bayesian priors**<span id='IJnJ8HW7C'/>
            - This process, unlike deductive reasoning, yields a plausible conclusion but does not positively verify it - **inference to the best explanation**<span id='sA4WCCLzU'/>
    - **inductive**<span id='-daHi59NS'/>
    - **Deductive**<span id='ohPM5ifug'/>
        - a valid deduction guarantees the truth of the conclusion<span id='Ug8u8R2SB'/>
- curious about how Andy thinks about **mapping**, would any of this thinking have been better done visually?<span id='9rOxzbHVJ'/>
- creates a note for the book, literature note<span id='tT5WxrSYT'/>
    - not evergreen, jumping off point, gets bibliography metadata from Zotero (manually)<span id='UyNHoBMg5'/>
        - wonder if he automatically pulls in these for citations<span id='hcjeruypj'/>
    - named autors comma title<span id='0Bt6gY9nW'/>
    - writes short summary - not copying from his daily note. Grounds his thinking, provides feedback about how well he understands the bookj.<span id='31cLFFsAA'/>
- coinage-oriented note, named after the authors - doesn't like this, means he hasn't properly digested it yet. Not sure if this concept has transcended the book yet (in wider usage)<span id='aIFKXpXKJ'/>
    - trying to put it in his own words, instead of copying<span id='W5VVMvunX'/>
- Example of using search, and working across a large number of notes<span id='64aI-OvWx'/>
