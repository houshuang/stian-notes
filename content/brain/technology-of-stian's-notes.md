title: "technology of stian's notes"
---

- This site is based on two main technologies. First I take all my notes on Roam, and export the JSON.<span id='BbamZr3uu'/>
- Then I use **roam-export** to process the output. This script is pretty messy, but has a lot of neat features<span id='vD_5V_3Y1'/>
    - automatically resolve embeds and block-embeds<span id='TKWZaCfN7'/>
    - queries<span id='NI4DQtsvi'/>
        - (I've got this working, but it's not quite integrated yet)<span id='RM86nDLA5'/>
    - advanced link handling<span id='0C5fwiqUj'/>
        - use a heuristic to see where I've added an external URL to a topic<span id='5pO_PZaKL'/>
        - for pages that are not part of the export, either convert internal URLs to external URLs, or turn them bold (to distinguish from links that actually go to internal pages with content)<span id='pIKhKnNSM'/>
    - automatically determine pages to export<span id='ntOCgFubp'/>
        - right now, it exports all pages linked directly from the about page, as well as any page or block that has the `public` tag. (If the tag is top-level on a page, the whole page is exported, but if I have a block on a daily page I want to export, I can just add that tag, and the whole block+children is exported as a page)<span id='FHd2AEO1N'/>
- Finally, I send the output to Gatsby, using a **Aengus McMillin**'s **gatsby-theme-brain** and **Aravind Balla's** **gatsby-theme-andy**, which gives the nice theme and automatic link preview.<span id='hM65n3Zyx'/>
- I have many ideas on how to improve this<span id='WBcspecE5'/>
    - Commenting, maybe even inline (using **Hypothes.is** or something else?)<span id='QkFnDSM3Z'/>
    - Tag some pages as blog posts, which get a date, a stream of posts, an RSS feed etc<span id='Uq3tmD9MC'/>
    - Render highlights (^^) correctly<span id='418siWKhZ'/>
    - Enable folding of long pages (example https://www.loom.com/share/246622d45cb844559ecfc2543ff1d55c using **react-treeview**)<span id='syBVDnTUd'/>
    - Interlinking with other people's **digital garden**s<span id='Km8ipMZY_'/>
