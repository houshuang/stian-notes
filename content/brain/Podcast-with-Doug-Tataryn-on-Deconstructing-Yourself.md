                - &#8203;<mark>I thought that you kind of could get that kind of insight, with walking meditation and always seeing your emotions from a distance, but maybe those states are not as deep or, or pure. </mark><span id='6K6wZHgTb'/>
            - And so, some of this developmental and cleansing and stuff, it's possible that you kind of see through it and so it becomes invisible to the meditation and you can gain enlightenment without actually having to deal with it.<span id='vvL5yMRog'/>

        - When trauma happens, you tend to incorporate those emotion, **feeling beliefs**, into your **personality** at a level where it's very difficult to untangle<span id='5A28Objc2'/>
        - Traditionally, people shut down emotionally at a certain age.<span id='IYvelmqEu'/>
        - Although they kept craving some kind of recognition or love, when they got that **it didn't update their core beliefs**, and it didn't heal, the kind of gap that they had.<span id='cczGKA2o2'/>
