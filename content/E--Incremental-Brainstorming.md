title: "E: Incremental Brainstorming"
---

- #public<span id='xGipZqT3R'/>
- the concept of effective incremental collaborative brainstorming... I know I've seen mockups of a mix between Slack and Roam, Twitter and Roam etc...<span id='0IjtruWc9'/>
- **Basically there is a linear/time-based perspective (because we live in a time-based world), a threaded perspective (I say something, you respond etc) and a networked (something I say is related to tons of other stuff)...**<span id='68HAoTusj'/>
    - How can we do this over time?<span id='wQb_w4Sh0'/>
        - Right now I'm slowly getting better at having small incremental processes that let me do a bit of foraging, a bit of chewing, a bit of digestion, etc every day, and feel that things gradually get better - even as I sneak these into gaps in my time at work, with family etc. (No more a PHD student where this is my full-time job)...<span id='Nun8cPz7r'/>
        - However, I haven't found great ways of doing this with friends... The granularity is off, and of course the interoperability...<span id='TNoFEBpcE'/>
            - big emails which sit around for a while, then get a big confusing answer across multiple channels... I'm now trying to capture more of what I write (and interesting stuff other people write) into Roam. Very small percentage of my emails that have interesting stuff, but what I'm writing right now is absolutely feeding one of my evolving concepts, and I'd be silly not to keep it (which is what I've been doing for the last 30 years of course, I was silly :))<span id='rt1ehhn5E'/>
            - quick messages (Roam, DMs, Facebook etc) - disconnected, don't "accrete"<span id='ADNAZvOyd'/>
            - more public brainstorms on Twitter - so many ideas across the screen, but usually when I post something I don't get a very useful insight (or maybe I get a link to an essay back but now I have a ton of work making sense of that)<span id='cLW9hIVWM'/>
            - video meetings - either in pairs or bigger. I've started recording these and running them through Otter - generate a ton of content (if good), but again you talk about tons of ideas over an hour, then meet again in a month, or never.<span id='PvcJscdrg'/>
            - Google docs that someone goes in and comments on (very common in companies and academia)<span id='g3a27Hqw0'/>
- Postal chess idea<span id='ykH215Ked'/>
    - taking a few minutes every single day to write down an idea or a question,<span id='B7chOO5LX'/>
    - something that doesn't take much time, but an has a back and forth.<span id='pgTu4AhmV'/>
    - Kind of like postal chess.<span id='lcUmp_Amc'/>
    - **But somehow accumulates, and not just linearly **<span id='Dk6fBVrYd'/>
    - voice is powerful.<span id='NqdiVUaUU'/>
    - Text.<span id='lOfCnbe7X'/>
    - There's a linear aspect to time,<span id='YABBOCrY5'/>
    - combined with a concept map.<span id='oKWbpTI7G'/>
        - Could there be a concept map with voice messages<span id='RtZ2irOpH'/>
        - or Twitter integration<span id='D6dTMMQPY'/>
        - or messages<span id='-a3OZ43o2'/>
        - And Google Docs, with comments.<span id='xcMqOuTte'/>
        - What are other tools that people use to build from scratch.<span id='nLH-ja2Ya'/>
            - The letter exchanges on **LetterWiki**.<span id='IbRAzrePi'/>
                - But they don't accumulate. There is no conclusion. And they're quite long and written to be read publicly.<span id='_fS8X2ffp'/>
                - **Ivan Illich** would walk into the room and lie down, and ask "what are you working on", and give a response (reference?).<span id='7JnYD1yiL'/>
                - How can we replicate that in a more distributed fashion.<span id='VW_8pwu6D'/>
                    - Both mentorship from above, and vertical or horizontal.<span id='Wn7Hghp-z'/>
                    - That could be an interesting Twitter thread.<span id='j0w9ApjAp'/>
