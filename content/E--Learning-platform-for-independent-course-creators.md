- #E #p #public<span id='z8r7TpcGo'/>
- People use **Skillshare** or **Teachable** for things like **roam-course**s<span id='DZadDu7w8'/>
- &#8203;<mark>Why are people able to command such a premium for such courses, especially if they are mainly collections of videos?</mark><span id='nDl0n_yXs'/>
- Basically just a Youtube playlist with payment/accounts? Why doesn't **Youtube** offer this?<span id='1obFB0Y4c'/>
- Others, like **Write of Passage** and **BASB-course** use a custom stack - payment, membership, Zoom, mailing lists etc?<span id='mSV8LRd4T'/>
- None of the MOOC providers (Course, EdX, Udacity) want to work with individuals (also not Minerva currently)<span id='Df8TVQ7Ba'/>
- Things people want<span id='uuIqGADpI'/>
    - easy set up, payment, promotion etc<span id='c-ldzTmFq'/>
    - white label - not "one more course on X platform", but "awesomecourse.com"<span id='0fzGh4TIc'/>
    - hosting video and curriculum (mostly video)<span id='FFjmnZzIf'/>
    - mailing lists / discussion forums<span id='1ed-Y9SWK'/>
    - cohort functionality<span id='A9SZWNaMH'/>
- One possibility would be for someone to use **OpenEdX** to set up a **Software-as-a-Service** for independent course creators, with payment etc integrated (**Stripe**?)<span id='_2Trb2HCV'/>
    - Authoring courses is a hassle, not sure it's worth it, given the small numbers.<span id='OXDYJf-Bh'/>
    - Maybe something like Canvas?<span id='MRI70m9Bc'/>
- Some of these courses also offer live video (Zoom etc) - what would it look like for Minerva to offer our services? Ideally through a reseller who could offer all of the other functionality, and bundle Forum access and training with payment, discussion forums, promotion, etc...<span id='k5OBFxjSR'/>
- Examples:<span id='t9ydd5G_m'/>
    - **Nat Eliason** has made $50,000 on a course on Roam Research which is basically just 20 short videos (95$ fee).<span id='25XqmUG8F'/>
    - **Tiago Forte** has taught 800 people on his Building a Second Brain course, minimum price is 999$.<span id='vlrfM6V4f'/>
    - &#8203;<mark>Other examples - how big a market is this, and how many would be interested in Teachables-style courses or a bit more interactive, versus full-on video etc?</mark><span id='7tfQXyC-F'/>
