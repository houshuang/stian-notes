    - Is it open source? Why not? Plan for development - actually trying to make it useful or mostly to test hypotheses for papers?<span id='ghdhLZIyG'/>

    - struggling to annotate and organize key claims from academic papers<span id='_LgJ6xPgw'/>
    - based on screenshots, even of text - which you title with a short summary<span id='4L25XoxwX'/>
    - these claims, linked to screenshots (and page number)? are available for spatial organization and linking<span id='GqK_d4lZh'/>
    - shares this with others, expanding annotations? flexible compression - zooming in and out?<span id='9D4_RGMvm'/>

    - Conducting an effective **literature review**<span id='t2li2j5hT'/>
        - What is currently known and unknown about topic?<span id='n68dmpXF1'/>
        - Crucial but difficult, especially cross-disciplinary<span id='B2eXP24XJ'/>
        - **sensemaking** is a core subtask:<span id='LDpQcjZtG'/>
            - researchers search for a new representation<span id='gAgo8O8tB'/>

            - that is based on existing ideas in the literature to guide their subsequent research<span id='j89Oe939f'/>
            - The process of searching for these representations is highly iterative,<span id='_-C3RySGn'/>
                - involving multiple shifts in mental representations supported by reinterpretations of data<span id='uz3k3qHBM'/>
            - Especially important for interdisciplinary research, where researchers cannot “hold the whole field” in their heads<span id='0YMILJCXP'/>
    - **Supporting the appropriate unit of interaction**<span id='vuybli3tA'/>
        - **grounded claim** - concise statement linked to key contextual details (evidence) (ZK?)<span id='tXbhv4HvT'/>
            - Grounded claims are: **concise statements - grounded in context**<span id='eKvUGLJKp'/>
                - Our idea for grounded claims is rooted in **models of scientific argumentation** that also specify a scientific statement, linked to evidence, as a basic unit of scientific discourse [8, 9, 16].<span id='2lwP_NZWx'/>

                - key point from CSCW research on knowledge reuse: knowledge items must be identified and evaluated, but also be recontextualized in order to be reused efectively [1].<span id='f_x6nsecd'/>

                - Claim: Scientists primarily read specific fragments of articles<span id='ZwNHUR8wG'/>
                - Evidence: Online journal logs, scientists view only 1-3 pages on average<span id='uts9to-O2'/>
                - Provenance<span id='94Q4spnRY'/>
                - Existing tools assume paper is unit of interaction (Mendeley, Zotero), iTunes for papers, tagging, citations etc.<span id='DPx3N-_w_'/>

    - Existing workflows for working with grounded claims:<span id='pxDhw-34e'/>
        - spreadsheets<span id='Ps1hDcAfY'/>
        - QDA software<span id='JkqthAcE1'/>
        - text editors<span id='CZIgLDy1X'/>
        - “micropublications” (bioinformatics)<span id='nM46gr5qJ'/>
    - Creating these have cognitive and interaction costs? (What are interaction costs/unit of interaction?)<span id='bxd7kSm5U'/>
        - cognitive cost of deciding in advance which details need to be retained as context for future reuse<span id='ttExoIyPd'/>
    - Using Knowledge Compressor to facilitate<span id='8AFIr97Le'/>
        - claims grounded by two kinds of context<span id='MS7poW9K7'/>
            - evidence: easily link to segments of PDF (text or graphs etc)<span id='TwhAj5NGY'/>
            - related claims (connect explicitly or implicitly by spatial proximity) to other claims on claim canvas<span id='MkFpXzf4j'/>
        - similar to argument diagramming / modelling software<span id='4G6JVGAKF'/>
    - **slices are flexible**, can be adjusted by reuser, because they are live slices of the source PDF<span id='hjENqVoh9'/>
        - Flexible compression mechanism for lowering cost - similar to conventional annotation. Select segment, type text. But segments are flexible - can be adjusted/expanded by reuse, live slices (using pdfs). Can also link directly back to document in reading page.<span id='1NjzWk08v'/>
        - Eases cognitive cost of deciding which part of the document count as context, and interaction cost of precisely specifying contextual details.<span id='OaGJ8RbqU'/>
        - (So interaction costs are more UX interaction?)<span id='0v4Bh4xs-'/>

    - Knowledge Compressor operates on a database of PDFs (basically a folder with PDFs and some other .json files in it). **We have preprocessed them for you.**<span id='pG1Wa90Uq'/>

    - Skimming very quickly through the paper, looking for claims and concepts<span id='dIgKkTz7N'/>
    - **Thoughts**<span id='NLiUfZCdx'/>
        - UI<span id='hgKdHtque'/>
            - How does it scale, and how do you work with large projects - do you keep adding to the same base, or have multiple sub-bases. (Would be cool to be able to build, for example building up to a claim, based on many sub-claims that all have evidence, and then linking to that claim in a broader context)<span id='LaZklMJNh'/>
            - You're assuming that all relevant information is co-located, and can be selected - perhaps this is the hallmark of a good paper? What if it's scattered around, you need two different pieces to create a claim etc?<span id='eXtoQVYrZ'/>
            - How important is the zoomability? Have they done user-studies on this? Intuitively I feel like you get a lot of the "lossless compression" by automatically maintaining a link back to the original PDF and location, without offering the visual zooming, but I might be wrong<span id='y1ie7filH'/>
        - Interoperability<span id='xTporiMoh'/>
            - Are there ways of exporting this data in a format that could be read for example by Roam? Would be great to grab the text of PDFs selected too, but still keep the link back to where it came from<span id='6tZOKScbd'/>
            - Ways in which this could interact with Roam, if Roam had a nice API - bringing these highlights into Roam (how to serialize from a 2D space?), but also grabbing Roam bullets and letting users visualize, map, link<span id='cidq-SvDc'/>
        - Functionality/tech<span id='czQPualL3'/>
            - is there any kind of search (at least in the text you write yourself?) - apparently some newer version has search<span id='xHNeQwQ07'/>
            - Why isn't it a web tool? Copyright? If just using pdfjs...<span id='s2-fDIh9t'/>
            - Auto-extract bibliographic metadata, and data about users/process? Not sure how to display<span id='_lwaXuXex'/>
            - How to access synthesis interface, and automatically extracted strings which he shows in video?<span id='SaJ9XgK3i'/>
        - Other tools<span id='9VIuKClZD'/>
            - Should definitively look at **Knowledge Forum**, how they use backgrounds, different views, rise-aboves etc (and talk to **Bodong Chen**). Also things like **Compendium** from **Knowledge Cartography** (I should revisit that book as well)<span id='FepLwieNa'/>
        - Collaboration<span id='wJKegK2Ag'/>
            - Talking about sharing maps - give a new PhD student a map, this is what we know... Relevant to [[Three levels of Note taking]]. Social features, annotation, disagreement, discovery? Comparing between different graphs, linking to different graphs... 🤯<span id='5CSxIGQ5l'/>
                - One thing is sharing maps in a small community, but what about publishing - what would it be like to publish a literature review written in such a way, where every claim links back - **citation ontologies** etc? Automatically import a citation ontology from another paper into your map?<span id='Jn7Kbowis'/>
                - Perhaps search engines could index your claims, and know which are the claims in a certain paper, which can help other people searching, even without you exposing your notes and thoughts directly to them<span id='pP6Qd28Zp'/>
    - Some research showing that if you create a mindmap of a vacation planning and you share with someone, the categories you have (things to do with kids, what to bring) are actually more useful to the other person, than the items you put in the buckets... So categories/landscape is important.<span id='q0fd-KPex'/>
    - In **bio-informatics** they have guidelines for how to write clear natural language summaries of research - relevant for how to best write the "labels" for these claims<span id='DdiAyqWro'/>
    - Also has a synthesis interface for writing, which can automatically search through your claims<span id='zBg_IUhXe'/>

            - so that you can work with many ideas at the same time, combine them, put them into larger structures, like arguments<span id='n3tEa26Fp'/>
